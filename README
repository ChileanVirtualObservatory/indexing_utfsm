cube_indexing.R runs the full pipeline of the system. 
It has dependences on EBImage, FITSio, and R. 

Source codes are organized into folders. 
Spectra processing codes are in cube_spectra.
Multiscale segmentation codes are in multiscale.
Indexing codes (to deal with a relational database) are in indexing.

Old codes are in get_objects, including image segmentation scripts.
